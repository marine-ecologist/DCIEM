```

## 

Working:

-   update TimeOut based on TimeIn
-   update EBT based on TimeOut (check `Handle case where TimeOut is on the next day`)
-   only allow entry where TimeOut is after TimeIn
-   Initiate "Add Entry" button and add rows

Not working:

-   Update TimeIn to be the same as the last row's TimeOut
