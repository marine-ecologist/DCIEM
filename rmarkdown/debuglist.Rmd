## 

Working:

-   update TimeOut based on TimeIn
-   update EBT based on TimeOut (check `Handle case where TimeOut is on the next day`)
-   only allow entry where TimeOut is after TimeIn
-   Initiate "Add Entry" button and add rows
-   Update TimeIn to be the same as the last row's TimeOut

Not working:

-   \`RG2\` is a version of \`RG\` where repetitive dives in a single day are incremental e.g. first - second dive can be A - B, but if the third dive is RG B-A or B-B then RG2 will always increase A-C unless SI=1.0 at the time of the next dive. Still need to code this into RG2 (can't think of a time this applies to a single RG dive in one day)

-   For example:

    ![](images/Screenshot%202024-03-10%20at%205.39.07%20am.png)

-   \^\^\^ this is incorrect as RG2 should reset when SI = 1

-   similarly should only increase IF a new dive is added

-   Needs fixing for accomodating multiday dive profiles and turning into a true "log"
