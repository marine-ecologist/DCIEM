1.  Enter the Date, Time In, Time Out, Bottom Time, MaxDepth, AirIn, and AirOut in the first box, then add entry.

2.  The dive planner will calculate Effective Bottom Time, Repetitive Group, Surface Interval, and Repetitve Factors from all dive entries.

#### Notes

**BT** = Bottom Time (i.e. start of descent to start of ascent)

EBT = Effective Bottom Time (Bottom time [BT] \* Repetitive Factor [RF])

**MaxDepth** = maximum depth in metres (round upwards)

RG = Repetitive Group

RG2 = conservative Repetitive Group

SI = Surface Interval (hh:mm)

RF = Repetitive Factor

-   Dives with \<15 minutes SI need to be manually combined (to be revised in a future version)
